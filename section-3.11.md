Question
How would you set up monitoring for the React Native mobile appâ€™s API endpoints?



Monitoring an API endpoint for a React Native mobile app involves tracking its availability, performance, and reliability. Here's a step-by-step guide to set up effective monitoring:


1. Use a Monitoring Service

Leverage Prometheus, Grafana and Postman Monitors to monitor your API.

Postman Monitors: Great for API performance and functional testing.

Prometheus and Grafana: Advanced monitoring with metrics collection and visualization.


2. Define Key Metrics to Monitor

Focus on these metrics:

Availability (Uptime): Checks if the API is online.

Response Time: Measures the time taken for the API to respond.

Error Rate: Tracks the percentage of failed requests.

Throughput: Monitors the number of requests per second.

Status Codes: Logs 4xx/5xx error codes.

Latency: Measures request processing time.


3. Set Up Health Checks

Add a health check endpoint (e.g., /health) to your API, which returns basic status information. For example:
```
{
  "status": "ok",
  "uptime": 123456,
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

4. Use a Synthetic Monitoring Tool

Set up synthetic tests that periodically call your API endpoints from multiple geographic locations. use Postman Monitors to do this:

Schedule requests to your API.

Validate responses (e.g., check for expected data in JSON).

Alert on failures or latency thresholds.

5. Instrument API with Monitoring Libraries

Use tools like OpenTelemetry or integrate APM (Application Performance Monitoring) solutions like New Relic, Datadog, or Elastic APM:

Track detailed metrics and traces for each API request.

Visualize slow queries or bottlenecks.

Get insights into errors and exceptions.


6. Create Dashboards

For Prometheus and Grafana:

Export API metrics using a library like Prometheus client in Node.js (or the server's language).

Set up Grafana panels for visual analysis.


7. Set Up Alerts with Prometheus Alertmanager

Configure alerting for issues such as:

API downtime.

High response times.

Excessive error rates.


Example: Using Prometheus + Grafana

a. Instrument Your API

Install a Prometheus client library (e.g., prom-client for Node.js):

npm install prom-client

Add metrics to your API:
```
const client = require('prom-client');
const httpRequestDurationMicroseconds = new client.Histogram({
  name: 'http_request_duration_seconds',
  help: 'Duration of HTTP requests in seconds',
  labelNames: ['method', 'route', 'status_code'],
});

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  const end = httpRequestDurationMicroseconds.startTimer();
  res.on('finish', () => {
    end({ method: req.method, route: req.path, status_code: res.statusCode });
  });
  next();
});

```
b. Scrape Metrics with Prometheus

Add your API as a target in Prometheus:

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'api-monitoring'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['your-api-url:port']


c. Visualize Metrics in Grafana

Import Prometheus metrics into Grafana.

Create custom dashboards to visualize and monitor the API's health.
