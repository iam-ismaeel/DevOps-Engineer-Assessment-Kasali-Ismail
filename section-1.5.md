Question
How would you design and implement a secure CI/CD architecture for microservice
deployment using GitOps? Take a scenario of 20 microservices developed using
different languages and deploying to an orchestrated environment like Kubernetes.
(You can add a low-level architectural diagram)


Designing and implementing a secure CI/CD architecture for 20 microservices using different languages and deploying to Kubernetes with GitOps (using ArgoCD) involves integrating best practices in security, scalability, and automation. Below is a detailed plan along with a low-level architectural diagram:


Key Components

1. Version Control System (VCS):
GitHub for managing source code repositories.

2. CI Pipeline:
Build and test each microservice in isolation using Github Actions.
Scan code for vulnerabilities with tools like SonarQube and Trivy.

3. Artifact Repository:
Store built images securely in AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) with proper access controls.

4. GitOps Tool:
ArgoCD for syncing Kubernetes manifests (Kustomize) from the Git repository to the cluster.

5. Kubernetes Cluster:
Use managed services(EKS).
Implement security best practices (RBAC, network policies).



6. Security Tools:
Secret Management: Use tools like HashiCorp Vault, Sealed Secrets, or external-secrets.
Image Scanning: Scan container images for vulnerabilities during CI and in the registry.

CI/CD Workflow
1. Developer Workflow:
Developers push code to a branch in the Git repository.
Trigger a CI pipeline to:
Lint and format code.
Run unit and integration tests.
Scan for vulnerabilities.
Build and push container images to a private ECR registry.

2. GitOps Workflow:
Update the Kubernetes manifests (Kustomize overlays) in the GitOps repo with the new image tag.
ArgoCD automatically syncs these changes to the Kubernetes cluster.

3. Deployment:
ArgoCD applies the Kubernetes manifests, deploying the updated microservice to the cluster.

Here is the structure of the architecture (described for textual representation):

Developer Workflow:
+---------------------------+
| Developer                 |
| Pushes Code               |
+---------------------------+
           |
           v
+---------------------------+
| Source Code Repository    |
| (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket) |
+---------------------------+
           |
           v
+------------------------------------+
| Continuous Integration Pipeline    |
| - Lint, Test, Scan                 |
| - Build Docker Images              |
| - Push to Artifact Repository      |
+------------------------------------+

           v

| Kubernetes Cluster        |
| - Deploy Microservices    |
| - Apply Network Policies  |
| - Use Vault/Secrets       |
+---------------------------+

Steps to Implement
1. Set Up Git Repositories:
Use a mono-repo or separate repositories for each microservice and GitOps configurations.

2. Implement CI Pipelines:
Configure CI pipelines to automate builds, tests, and vulnerability scanning.

3. Set Up ArgoCD:
Install ArgoCD in the Kubernetes cluster.
Connect ArgoCD to the GitOps repository.

4. Secure Kubernetes:
Define namespace-level isolation.
Apply network policies and security contexts.

5. Monitor and Alert:

Use Prometheus, Grafana,EFK anf jaeger for observability.
Set up alerts for deployment issues or security incidents.
