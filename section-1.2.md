Question 
How do you design a self-healing distributed service?


Designing a self-healing distributed service involves creating a system that can detect, isolate, and recover from failures automatically without human intervention. Below are the key principles and strategies that i used to achieve this:

1. Modular and Decoupled Architecture
Usage of microservices or a service-oriented architecture to isolate components.
Ensured services communicate through well-defined APIs or event-driven messaging to reduce dependencies.

2. Health Monitoring and Diagnostics
Implemented active health checks:
Used health endpoints (/health) in services to report their status.
Monitored critical metrics like CPU, memory, disk usage, and response times.
Used tools Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for visualization.
Implemented distributed tracing (Jaeger, OpenTelemetry) to monitor request flows across services.

3. Fault Detection
Configured logs for real-time error detection using systems like ELK Stack or Fluentd.

4. Automatic Failure Recovery
Replication and Redundancy:
Ensured horizontal scaling with redundant nodes to tolerate failures.
Used replication strategies in databases (master-slave).
Service Restarts:
Used Kubernetes to restart failed pods and Define Kubernetes readiness and liveness probes.
Traffic Redirection:
Used load balancers (NGINX) to route traffic away from unhealthy instances.

5. Self-Healing Mechanisms
Retry Policies:
Implemented exponential backoff and jitter for failed requests.
Failover Mechanisms:
Automatically switched to standby nodes or replicas during failures.
Isolation:
Used bulkheads to isolate parts of the system and prevent failure propagation.

6. Proactive Scaling
Used autoscaling policies to handle increased load and avoid failures due to resource exhaustion.
Monitor queue lengths, CPU/memory utilization, and other signals to trigger scaling.

7. Immutable Infrastructure
Used containerization (Docker) for reproducible builds and environments.
Adopted infrastructure-as-code (Terraform) for automated provisioning.

11. Feedback and Learning
Analyzed failures to identify root causes and improve the system.
Used AI/ML models for predictive analysis to preemptively resolve potential issues.
